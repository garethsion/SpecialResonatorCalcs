Installation
============

This package has been designed for easy interfacing with Linux or Mac OS operating systems. It is possible to use this package on Windows operating systems, but the ssh commands may not work so well. I will modify the package for Windows at a later date.

To install the package, open a terminal window and type the command::

    pip install qsdcalcs

This will download the package to your computer.
